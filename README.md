# Overview
This software project from Jabra helps developers to make solutions, where basic headset call control can be used from within a browser app using JavaScript. Since it is not possible to access USB devices directly from JavaScript, this library provides a solution of getting a route from the JavaScript to the Jabra USB device. The API is a JavaScript library with a facade that hides implementation details. Basic call control is defined by off-hook/on-hook, ringer, mute/unmute and hold/resume. With these features, it is possible to implement a browser based softphone app. Combined with the [WebRTC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebRTC) technology it is possible to create a softphone that only requires small software components installed locally on the computer, while the business logic is implemented in JavaScript.

## Project goals
* be able to control a headset from JS
* be a lightweight solution
* support the platforms: Windows and macOS

## System requirements
With current internal implementation of this software package, the following systems are supported. 

### Jabra devices
All professional Jabra headsets and Jabra speakerphones are supported. I.e. the [Jabra Evolve series](https://www.jabra.com/business/office-headsets/jabra-evolve), the Jabra Pro series, the Jabra Biz series, and the [Jabra Speak series](https://www.jabra.com/business/speakerphones/jabra-speak-series).

### Operating system support
The following desktop operating systems are supported:

| Operating system  | Version            | 
| ----------------- | ------------------ | 
| Windows 64 bit    | Windows 7 or newer | 
| Windows 32 bit    | Windows 7 or newer | 
| macOS             | El Capitan/Sierra             | 

### Browser support
Google Chrome web browser - stable channel - 32 bit and 64 bit.

## Using the library 
Developers must use the JavaScript library file: `jabra.browser.integration-1.1.js` 
The library internally checks for dependencies – and will report this to the app using the library. An example: The Jabra library is initialized and an error callback function is called with this text and a link: “You need to use this Extension and then reload this page”. Note that a future version could change the internal implementation and that removes/adds new requirements.
